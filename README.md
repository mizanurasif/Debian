o	AI Math Assistant for Samsung Notes for AI POC
      	The Samsung Notes AI Math Assistant enhances mathematical problem-solving by recognizing, classifying, and solving handwritten or printed equations directly within Samsung Notes. It leverages AI   for OCR,           classification, solving, and graphing, ensuring seamless integration with Samsung devices.
o	Zoom Beyond Limit: Creating Gigapixel Experience on Mobile in Idea Contest
	      A multi-camera smartphone (like Galaxy S25 Ultra) to capture fewer, smarter images at different zoom levels. Using AI-guided stitching where lower-zoom images guide the positioning of higher-zoom details.           Automatic AI upscaling to enhance image clarity without needing multiple lenses or hundreds of shots. Seamless tiling and navigation so the final gigaphoto can be explored interactively on any device. A             mobile-first design that removes the need for tripods, desktop stitching, or Photoshop finishing.
